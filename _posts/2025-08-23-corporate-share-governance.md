# A Meritocratic Governance Framework: The Corporate Share Citizenship Model

## Introduction

This model draws inspiration from prior conceptualizations in alternative governance, such as Curtis Yarvin's (writing as Mencius Moldbug) neocameralism, which envisions government as a profit-driven corporation with sovereign shareholders [](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/summer-reads/article/2025/07/22/peter-thiel-the-libertarian-billionaire-waging-war-on-government_6743617_183.html).

In the pursuit of innovative societal structures, the Corporate Share Citizenship Model emerges as a compelling paradigm that integrates economic incentives with civic participation. This framework conceptualizes a community as a sovereign corporation, wherein shares function not merely as financial instruments but as symbols of merit and engagement. By rendering citizenship tiers relative rather than absolute, the model adapts dynamically to the evolving scale and contributions within the entity. Herein, we explore its components, benefits, and implications, treating the figure of 200 shares as an illustrative guideline rather than a fixed threshold. This approach ensures flexibility, allowing tiers to adjust proportionally based on the distribution of earned shares across participants.

## Core Principles of Share Allocation

At the heart of this model lies a merit-based system for share distribution, designed to reward actions that enhance communal welfare. Shares are awarded through verifiable achievements, fostering a culture of sustained contribution. For instance:

- **Educational Milestones** üìö: Completing secondary education might confer a modest allocation, such as 2 shares, incentivizing lifelong learning.
- **Professional or Community Service** ü§ù: Roles in public sectors or voluntary initiatives could yield higher increments, e.g., 10 shares per term, recognizing direct societal impact.
- **Advanced Contributions** üî¨: Attaining higher qualifications or leading innovations would provide scaled additions, calibrated to reflect exceptional value.

Rather than enforcing a rigid cap at 200 shares, this figure serves as a suggested benchmark for maximum individual accumulation. In practice, the effective cap could vary based on the total shares in circulation, ensuring no single participant dominates while accommodating growth. This relativity promotes equity, as the system recalibrates periodically to maintain proportional influence.

## Relative Citizenship Tiers

Citizenship within this framework is gradated, with tiers determined relative to the overall share distribution‚Äîperhaps via percentiles or quartiles‚Äîrather than absolute thresholds. This adaptive structure allows for fluidity as the community expands:

- **Entry-Level Tier** (e.g., Bottom 25% of Earned Shares) üö™: Grants foundational rights, including residency and access to essential services, encouraging initial integration.
- **Associate Tier** (e.g., 26‚Äì50% Range) üìà: Affords enhanced privileges, such as priority in resource allocation and limited advisory input, rewarding moderate contributions.
- **Full Tier** (e.g., 51‚Äì75% Range) üèõÔ∏è: Confers comprehensive entitlements, including property rights and participation in decision-making forums, for those demonstrating substantial merit.
- **Elite Tier** (e.g., Top 25%) üåü: Reserves leadership roles and advanced influence for exemplars, ensuring that high achievers guide strategic directions.

By framing tiers relativistically, the model mitigates disparities arising from varying community sizes or achievement rates, promoting inclusivity without diluting meritocratic rigor.

## Economic Mechanisms: Tradability and Dividends

To infuse vitality into the system, shares are rendered tradable on an open market, enabling participants to leverage their holdings for personal or communal advancement. Dividends, distributed equitably as resource credits or financial returns, are tied to the entity's performance, creating a virtuous cycle wherein collective success amplifies individual gains.

Voting power, however, remains constrained by the interplay of earned achievements and owned shares, capped at the suggested benchmark (e.g., equivalent to 200 shares' influence). This dual mechanism ensures that market transactions enhance economic fluidity without compromising governance integrity.

## Governance and Benefits

Oversight is vested in a board of directors, selected from elite-tier members, which balances operational efficiency with consultative input from assemblies. The framework's benefits include:

- **Long-Term Orientation** ‚è≥: By prioritizing merit over wealth, it counters short-term biases, fostering sustainable development.
- **Inclusivity and Adaptability** üîÑ: Relative tiers and flexible caps accommodate diverse contexts, enhancing resilience.
- **Economic Vitality** üíπ: Tradability attracts investment, while dividends align incentives with communal prosperity.

## Conclusion

In summary, the Corporate Share Citizenship Model offers a principled alternative to traditional governance, harmonizing individual agency with collective advancement through its meritocratic and adaptive design.
